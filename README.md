# Computer-Vision-Tensorflow

This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects built using the TensorFlow framework. The projects include implementation of various deep learning algorithms for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

# Projects included
Image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
Object detection using Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD)
Semantic segmentation using Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation and style transfer
Transfer learning using pre-trained models such as VGG16 and ResNet50

# Getting started
To get started with this project, you will need to have TensorFlow and other required dependencies installed. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a README file with instructions on how to run the code.
